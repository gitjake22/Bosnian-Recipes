        <h1>Burek</h1>

        <img src="../images/burek1.jpg" alt="Burek">
        <p><em>This Bosnian recipe for meat burek or burek sa mesom is made with flaky phyllo dough (sometimes called filo dough) and ground beef (or a combination of beef, pork, and lamb) and formed in a 9 x 13-inch pan. It also can be shaped into a cylinder and then coaxed into a horseshoe shape or baked in a large round pan.</em></p>

        <p>Bureks, or savory pies, exist throughout the Balkans, Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East. They can be formed into horseshoe shapes, coils, cylinders, or round pies and are eaten as appetizers or as a main course. Some people consider them the quintessential hangover food, especially with a cold glass of kefir.</p>
